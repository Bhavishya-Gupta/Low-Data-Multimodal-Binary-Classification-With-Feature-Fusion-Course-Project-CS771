please ensure the following libraries are installed :-

import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Importing Matplotlib for plotting
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder, StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from catboost import CatBoostClassifier  # Import CatBoost
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from sklearn.base import clone

we have commented out all the plt.show() commands but if you wish to have a look over the plots, u may uncomment it although we have attached the same plots already in our latex.

after all the above steps are completed, just run 77.py to get all the text files containing predictions, we didn't use read_data.py because we felt more comfortable with writing our 
own code(77.py).

Thanks
